[Towards Complex Backgrounds: A Unified Difference-Aware Decoder for Binary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15156)

**Jiepan Li**, Wei He, Hongyan Zhang

[**Code**](https://github.com/Henryjiepanli/DAD)
- A new unified dual-branch decoder paradigm named the difference-aware decoder is proposed in this paper to explore the difference between the foreground and the background and separate the objects of interest in optical images.
